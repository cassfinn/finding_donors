    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "SVM's can model non-linear decision boundaries, and there are many kernels to choose from. They are also fairly robust against overfitting, especially in high-dimensional space. SVM work well for linearly separable data. For data that's not linearly separable, kernels can be used to project the data to a higher dimension in order to get it to be linearly separable. SVMs are effective when there are a large number of features.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "** What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?** <br>\n",
    "SVM are memory intensive. They can take a longer time to run than other models such as Random Forest models. They can be very slow and consume a lot of memory. SVMs can require more time in parameter selection, for example picking the right kernel in order to reduce the error percentage. <br>\n",

    "** What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?** <br>\n",
    "The Support Vector Machine model would be a good candidate because it is one of the best performing models for binary classifications. Our objective is to separate the census data into two classifications: income above 50K and income at or below 50K. SVM is a robust, supervised learning model which allows us to select from a variety of kernels and other parameters such as gamma and C in order to optimize performance for our dataset. The SVM classifier can build a model which divides the data into the two classifications and can then be used to predict classes for new examples. \n",

It generates a number of Decision Tree classifiers on sub-samples of the dataset and then averages the results to improve the accuracy of predictions. Random Forests grows many classification trees. Each tree gives a classification and \"votes\" for that class. The forest chooses the classification that has the most votes.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "** Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.** <br>\n",
    "Random Forest can be applied in banking, to determine whether a person who applies for a loan should or should not be given a loan. The model could look at features of existing customers which are similar to the applicant's and determine which have paid or not repaid loans in order to predict whether this applicant is likely to repay the loans and what interest rate to charge the customer. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "** What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?** <br>\n",
    "Random Forest can be used for both classification and regression tasks. Numerical features do not need to be scaled with random forests. They are able to detect feature importance so that the dataset can be reduced to the most important features and get good results. They are fast to train. They handle missing data well.\n",
    "\n",
    "** What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?** <br>\n",
    "There is a tendency for overfitting with the Random Forest model. According to scikit-learn.org, \"The default values for the parameters controlling the size of the trees (e.g. max_depth, min_samples_leaf, etc.) lead to fully grown and unpruned trees which can potentially be very large on some data sets. To reduce memory consumption, the complexity and size of the trees should be controlled by setting those parameter values.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "** What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?** \n",
    "<br>Random Forest would be a good candidate for the problem because it is very good at multiple classification type problems. Random Forest is a supervised classification algorithm which fits a number of decision trees on subsets of the dataset. It selects the highest scoring trees, giving a high accuracy result. Random Forest would work well for this classification task of splitting the data into two categories: income above 50K and income at or below 50K. Random Forest is also good at handling a mixture of numerical and categorical features such as what we have in our dataset. \n",

    "### Implementation - Creating a Training and Predicting Pipeline\n",
    "To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Import `fbeta_score` and `accuracy_score` from [`sklearn.metrics`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics).\n",
    " - Fit the learner to the sampled training data and record the training time.\n",
    " - Perform predictions on the test data `X_test`, and also on the first 300 training points `X_train[:300]`.\n",
    "   - Record the total prediction time.\n",
    " - Calculate the accuracy score for both the training subset and testing set.\n",
    " - Calculate the F-score for both the training subset and testing set.\n",

    "We will be using the Logistic Regression model to classify the data into two groups: over 50K and 50K and under. Logistic regression is useful for binary classification problems. The logistic function can take a number and map it into a value between 0 and 1, but never exactly at those limits. Input values are combined and weighted to predict an output value. \n",
    "The Logistic Regression model takes the input data and makes a prediction about the probability of the input being positive or negative (true or false).  If the probability is greater than 0.5, then the output is considered a prediction for the positive class (1 = true), otherwise the prediction is for the negative class (false).<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression is commonly used to predict the probability of something being either in one category or the other. Unlike a linear regression model which would predict continuous values including below 0 and over 1, the logistic regression model produces a probability within the range of 0 to 1. Given a set of important features in our datset such as age, hours-per-week, capital-gain, marital-status and education-num, and after being trained with over 36,000 examples, the logistic regression model becomes very good at predicting which people in the census data are likely to have income over 50K. \n",
    "\n",
    "The way logistic regression works is we supply the model with training data which includes examples of data where income is over 50K and examples of data where income is at or below 50K, along with a set of features. The set of features are the input values, for example age and education-num, that correspond to whether the person's income is higher or lower than 50K.  The model takes the set of input features and estimates a weighted value (coefficient) for each from the training data.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The model uses a minimization algorithm to optimize the best values for the coefficients to produce a logistive curve that best fits the training data. Once the model coefficients have been estimated, we now have a formula that can use the resulting logistic function to estimate the probability that any given person earns more or less than 50K given the feature set.\n",
    "\n",
    "People whose estimated probability of income being above 50K is greater than 50% (0.5) are predicted to be in the positive class. Otherwise, they are predicted to be in the negative class.\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
